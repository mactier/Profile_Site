                                        MySA in a web app CRM solution for the business partners if IBM. On the project I
                                        was lead Software engineer in test for my squad. I was responsible for front end UI
                                        automation of the product. This involved rewriting automation code and identifying
                                        what development feature stories were suitable for automation.
                                        Along with other members of the team I was also responsible for the SCRUM process on
                                        the team as a whole involved 3 squads plus stakeholders. While we had no scrum
                                        master and as such we had a revolving Scrum Master that we designated the Iteration
                                        Master that changed every quarter, during this time I ran and helped run the daily
                                        stand up, retrospectives, sprint planning and grooming, end of sprint demos and demo
                                        planning, defect triage and helping to remove blockers and impediments, Spotify
                                        health check and Agile assessment and taking care of the scrum board/wall of work
                                        and burn up and down charts, for both the team I was on and the wider test
                                        team/guild. I also mentored a number of new and existing people on the team in the
                                        SCRUM agile methology as well as in coding and the company as a whole. A branch off
                                        from the SalesConnect application MySA (MySA FVT Automation) is designed to replace

                                        Partners (IBM product resellers) From the ground up this is a fully Agile project
                                        with co-location of the team and squads. and is aiming towards full Test driven
                                        development (currently still training up existing testers to be able to work with
                                        FVT Automation) MySA is a web interface that pulls data with open API’s from the
